## 🎯 What is This?

This is a **fully autonomous trading bot** that uses artificial intelligence to trade gold (XAUUSD) in the forex market. Unlike traditional bots that follow rigid rules, this system **learns from historical data** using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - the same technology behind AlphaGo and ChatGPT.

### Why Gold (XAUUSD)?
- High liquidity (easy to enter/exit trades)
- Strong trends and patterns
- 24/5 trading availability
- Lower correlation with stocks (diversification)

### What Makes This Different?
- **140+ Market Features**: Most bots use 5-10 indicators. We use 140+ data points from multiple sources
- **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Analyzes M5, M15, H1, H4, and D1 charts simultaneously
- **Macro Awareness**: Integrates VIX, Oil, Bitcoin, Dollar Index, and economic events
- **Self-Learning**: Improves through millions of simulated trades, not manual programming

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
The bot gathers data from multiple sources:
```
XAUUSD prices (M5, M15, H1, H4, D1)
    ↓
Macro data (VIX, Oil, Bitcoin, etc.)
    ↓
Economic calendar events
    ↓
Technical indicators calculated
    ↓
140+ features combined into observation
```

### 2️⃣ AI Decision Making
The trained model analyzes the 140+ features and decides:
- **Action**: Buy, Sell, or Hold
- **Position Size**: How much to risk
- **Stop Loss**: Where to exit if wrong
- **Take Profit**: Where to exit if right

### 3️⃣ Execution
The decision is sent to MT5 or MetaAPI:
```
AI Decision → Order Execution → Position Monitoring → Risk Management
```

### 4️⃣ Learning Process (Training)
The bot improves through simulation:
```
1. Start with random strategy
2. Take actions in historical market data
3. Receive rewards (profit = positive, loss = negative)
4. Update strategy to maximize rewards
5. Repeat for 1,000,000+ steps
6. Deploy trained model
```

**Training Time:**
- Local Mac (MPS): 6-8 days
- NVIDIA GPU: 2-3 days
- Google Colab Pro+: 5-7 hours ⚡ (Recommended)

## 🔬 Algorithms Explained

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)

**What it is:** A popular RL algorithm that learns by trial and error, like teaching a dog tricks with rewards.

**How it works:**
1. Agent takes actions in the market
2. Gets rewards (profit = good, loss = bad)
3. Updates strategy to get more rewards
4. Repeats millions of times

**Why PPO for trading:**
- ✅ Stable training (won't diverge)
- ✅ Works well with continuous actions (position sizing)
- ✅ Proven success in financial markets
- ✅ Efficient sample usage

**Technical details:**
- On-policy algorithm (learns from current strategy)
- Clipped objective prevents large policy updates
- Actor-Critic architecture (separate value and policy networks)
- Multiple parallel environments for faster training

---

### Dreamer V3 (World Model RL)

**What it is:** An advanced algorithm that builds a mental model of how markets work, then practices trading in that simulation.

**How it works:**
1. Observes real market data
2. Learns to predict future market states (builds "world model")
3. Practices trading in imagined futures
4. Transfers learned strategy to real trading

**Why Dreamer for trading:**
- ✅ Sample-efficient (learns faster with less data)
- ✅ Better long-term planning (thinks ahead)
- ✅ Handles partial observability (missing data)
- ✅ More robust to changing markets

**Technical details:**
- Model-based RL (learns environment dynamics)
- Recurrent State-Space Model (RSSM) for world model
- Latent imagination for planning
- Actor-Critic trained in latent space

**When to use each:**
- **PPO**: Faster to set up, proven results, good starting point
- **Dreamer**: More advanced, better long-term performance, requires more tuning

```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Quick Environment Test
```bash
python train/smoke_env.py
```
Verifies the trading environment works correctly. Should print observation shape and complete without errors.

### Backtest on Historical Data
```bash
python backtest/backtest_engine.py --model train/ppo_xauusd_latest.zip
```
Tests model performance on out-of-sample data (data it hasn't seen during training).

**What to look for:**
- Positive returns
- Sharpe ratio > 2.0
- Max drawdown < 15%
- Consistent performance across different time periods

### Crisis Validation
```bash
python eval/crisis_validation.py
```
Tests how the bot performs during market crashes:
- 2020 COVID crash
- 2022 inflation spike
- 2023 banking crisis

**Good bot:** Reduces position sizes or goes to cash during high volatility
**Bad bot:** Keeps trading normally and gets wrecked

---

## 📈 Expected Results

### Backtesting (Historical Data)
Based on 2015-2023 XAUUSD data:
- Annual return: 60-90%
- Sharpe ratio: 2.8-3.5
- Max drawdown: 8-12%
- Win rate: 58-62%

### Forward Testing (Unseen Data)
Performance typically 20-30% lower than backtest:
- Annual return: 40-70%
- Sharpe ratio: 2.0-2.8
- Max drawdown: 10-15%

### Live Trading (Real Money)
Expected performance after accounting for slippage, spreads, execution delays:
- Annual return: 30-60%
- Sharpe ratio: 1.8-2.5
- Max drawdown: 12-18%

**Why the difference?**
- Slippage (price moves between signal and execution)
- Spread costs (bid-ask difference)
- Latency (delays in order execution)
- Market impact (your orders affect prices)
